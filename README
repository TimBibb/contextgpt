### ContextGPT

ContextGPT adds long term memory to your LLM conversations.

By saving your previous messages in ChromaDB (a local embeddings database), ContextGPT can remember key things about you, and reference them in future conversations.
The main goal of ContextGPT is to provide a platform for longterm memory and consistency between your conversations.
